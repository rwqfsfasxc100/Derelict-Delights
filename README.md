# Derelict-Delights
Fulfil your derelict-hunting dream with this mod. All remaining 13 ship types and variants not usually found in the rings can now be found from both miners and in derelict form.

This mod currently adds:
* 26 new events!
* NPC miners now can utilize all TNTRL variants (except the K44), Cothon variants, Eagle variants, AT-K225 variants (except modified variant), OCP-209, and the Kitsune.
* New ship configs for the dealership, NPC, and derelict ships.
* Added a new container variant: the THI Interlunar Container, rogue form can be found randomly in the rings and be sold by pirates too.
* Experimental Interplanetary containers can be found randomly in the rings, which may contain some loot for capturing them. 
* More dialogue options for random crew interactions.
* The Ganymedeans have started to take use of the Eagle Prospectors they've been stockpiling, and using them with the more powerful equipment they have taken from piracy.
* The Ganymedeans now have a chance to sell a ship other than the default 3 (K37, Eagle Prospector, Cothon-212). As a result to the increase in ship opportunities, the weight to be offered an ore container has been increased sevenfold, and the weights for the vanilla 3 ship offers have been increased fourfold each, resulting in a 50.6/49.4 container-to-ship offer ratio.
* Vilcy utilize their contracts with Obonto Habitats to put their point defence turrets on Titans, and use them in extreme cases of caution.
* You can now ask a container to supply a new one nearby, at a cost of course.
* Empty, inert containers can be found in the rings.
* You can find a new Habitat, SRA-08, under construction in the rings.
* Added a new crew agenda: the Historian
* Questline with the historian unlocks the interplanetary line of cargo container
* Mod support for the following mods: Industries of Enceladus (1.7.5 + Rewrite), K-Tech Industrial Shipyard, Drone OCP, Heavy Cothon
* Fully configurable from a config file within your save folder

## NOTES
1. If you have any suggestions for this mod, please feel free to comment on the mod's [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/426287934870781952/1316256288329699419). If you want to suggest a new ship loadout configuration, check out [this Google form here](https://forms.gle/yzvbGmaWeHWH9ChK8), and it should give you a quick dropdown selection for each equipment on a ship to save time and not clog up the Discord channel.
2. The K225 and K225-BB's THICCs act similarly to Rogue THICCs. Even the cargo containers have opted to include the NT Companions' work ethic.
