# Derelict-Delights
Fulfil your derelict-hunting dream with this mod. All remaining 14 ship types and variants not usually found in derelict form can now be found deserted within the rings.

## NOTES
1. All derelicts added by this mod use the K37's derelict spawn chances. Check [this wiki page](https://delta-v.kodera.pl/index.php/Profit_Strategy_-_Derelicts#Finding_Derelicts_in_the_Wild) to understand more on how derelicts spawn, and if you have any suggestions as to how rare or common a ship type is, please feel free to comment on the mod's Discord post.
2. The K225 and K225-BB's THICCs act similarly to Rogue THICCs. Even the cargo containers have opted to include the NT Companions' work ethic.
