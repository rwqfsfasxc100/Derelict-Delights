DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_K44|I have one of those failed K44 prototype thingies. Turns out they do actually exist and not just a myth. The transponder still has some power, but it's a total wreck. You can take it off of my hands for 250 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_217|I have an experimental Cothon stored away. The processed hold is reduced, but doesn't have the sectioned constraints of normal holds. You can take it for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_PEACOCK|I've got a luxury Prospector in a good spot. Leather seats and everything, I almost feel bad about giving it up but whatever. It's yours for 300 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTA24|Got a KTA tug out about. Looks like it could make a good vessel for our operations, but the front thrusters are funky. Fit some proper gear to it and it could be great. Take it for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KX37|Found an extended K37 model after some guy had overstressed it. Good enough nick to take, but I wouldn't say it's flightworthy. 200 grand for the hunk.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KR37|We've got a research K37 around here. Bit small for our liking, but has all the inns and outs of a K37, minus the size of everything. Comes fitted with a Faraday cage and everything too. We'll take 200 grand for the piece.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KITSUNE|One of the demilitarized Kitsunes landed our way, and we've had one lying around. Didn't really see much point in using one, so may as well make an offer to you for it. We're offering 200 grand flat for it.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_213|I've got an old Cothon here, except this one's got a neat thing up it's sleeve. Three engines instead of one, packs a punch but it's Faraday cage is lost. Selling it at 200k.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_211|We've got a belter Cothon here. Excavator's larger than standard models, and is a little offset from te center. Damage is here and there, but it's still in one piece. I'll let you take it for 200 000 E$

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_BALD|Got our hands on a Bald Eagle of all things. Owner lost a race to a Cothon of all things, and abandoned it in shame. Still a lovely piece of work dented or not. 600 grand and the bird is yours to collect.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_PELICAN|We've got our hands on a large Prospector. It's bay is huge for what it is, and it's mass is probably what got it in trouble to begin with. I couldn't tell you if it's flightworthy with the state it's in. 250 grand for it and I hope you'll see it gone.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_VULTURE|I've got a Prospector-K37 hybrid build stored up around here. It's nice to have with it's equipment, but sure is it uncomfortable to fly. We want it off our hands and will hand you the coords for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_OCP|Some of the construction crew for Obonto Seven left one of their ships unlocked while on an inspection break. Somehow managed to take it without them noticing until too late. It's too unwieldy for our liking, so you can take a look for 300 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_TITAN|Got a derelict Titan of all things stored up, cargo pods and everything. Huge thing it is, but damages to the rim and back. We can let you take it for half a mega.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_TITAN_BB|Have one of those hollowed-out Titans at hand. Beast of a ship with a cargo bay of an even bigger beast, although it does lack some of it's bays. We're offering half a mega for it.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_TITAN_M|A buddy discovered this very weird modification of a Titan. All of the docking bays got switched out with torch fittings, and it seems to have gotten a research package installed. Got the Faraday cage and everything. Looked like we weren't the first ones there as the airlock was broke. You can take it to fix up for a mega.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_EIME|Found an EIME abandoned not too far from here. Surprising find to us at least as those ships are tough as nails when we try to engage with them. It's a total wreck, but you can have it for 750 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_K37_I|I have a K37 in decent condition, still with transponders. Bit of holes in the reactor and some stains, but nothing a good mechanic can't take care of. I can sell it to you for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_I|We have a Prospector for sale. Cleared on the station a legitimate derelict after a mining accident. That one is not spaceworthy. 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_I|I got my hands on an early Cothon, in pretty good condition. Legitimate salvage, transponder still on, listed as missing. The reactor is still a bit leaky. On sale for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_I|We have some ore to sell. High quality, processed, just waiting in the rings in a nice, tidy container. You just need to bring a cradle with you and grab it. 100 grand and it's yours.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_II|We have some ore to sell. High quality, processed, just waiting in the rings in a nice, tidy container. You just need to bring a cradle with you and grab it. 100 grand and it's yours.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_V|We have some ore to sell. High quality, processed, just waiting in the rings in a nice, tidy container. You just need to bring a cradle with you and grab it. 100 grand and it's yours.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_VI|We have a large quantity of ore to sell. High quality processed ore, stored in one of THI's supercontainers. You just need to bring a cradle and your wits with you to grab it. 100 grand and it's yours.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_BIG_INSTRUCTIONS|Pleasure doing business with you. The container won't recognize you and will try to evade you. Like usual, it's no racing drone, however it's got a heck of a lot more power behind it than the usual THICC. Look for a LIDAR contact and go after it. Remember to bring a cradle or an arm - it will shut itself down once you are in EVA distance.

SYSTEM_EXBIG|THI Interlunar Container

SYSTEM_EXBIG_DESC|From the success that THI's previous cargo solutions venture had become, they started work on a successor that would be increasingly practical for interplanetary transportation. As successful as the initial venture was, the containers were too bulky for commercial use, so a consumer-grade model was produced for interlunar transportation between the rings. Considerably more managable for miners, and the lack of a need for specialized thrust to power them made maintenance equivalent to that of the original Cargo Container line, however installation costs still make the THICC popular among startups.

SYSTEM_EXBIG_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 45,000 kg / mineral \nPower usage (nominal): 20 MW \nDry Mass: 5,000 kg \nCradle mass: 500 kg \nReaction Mass Tank: 4,500 kg \nManufacturer: Titan Heavy Industries, Experimental Resize

SYSTEM_EXBIG_MANUAL|Automatically stores processed ore.\nYou can customize ore stored on Geologist tab.\nRequires mineral processing unit to be used effectively.\nWill unbalance the ship if only one is installed.\nCan be ejected by disabling the hardpoint.\nThe ejected container will attempt to return to the station with its cargo automatically.\nEmpty cradle arm can catch drones and lifepods.

POI_SCRAP|Mining Incident Site

DIALOG_POI_RANDOM_6|Captain, one of my old colleagues looked me out in my quarters while we were back on Enceladus. They told me that my old captain had gotten into a mining incident. Can we take a look to see if they're ok?

DERELICTDELIGHTS_SUGGEST|Suggest New Ship Loadouts

DIALOG_STORAGE_THX|Container should appear on LIDAR soon. You will need to manually collect the container for safety protocols. Note that containers cannot be sent in quick succession.
