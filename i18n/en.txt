DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_K44|I have one of those failed K44 prototype thingies. Turns out they do actually exist and not just a myth. The transponder still has some power, but it's a total wreck. You can take it off of my hands for 250 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_217|I have an experimental Cothon stored away. The processed hold is reduced, but doesn't have the sectioned constraints of normal holds. You can take it for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_PEACOCK|I've got a luxury Prospector in a good spot. Leather seats and everything, I almost feel bad about giving it up but whatever. It's yours for 300 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTA24|Got a KTA tug out about. Looks like it could make a good vessel for our operations, but the front thrusters are funky. Fit some proper gear to it and it could be great. Take it for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KX37|Found an extended K37 model after some guy had overstressed it. Good enough nick to take, but I wouldn't say it's flightworthy. 200 grand for the hunk.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KR37|We've got a research K37 around here. Bit small for our liking, but has all the inns and outs of a K37, minus the size of everything. Comes fitted with a Faraday cage and everything too. We'll take 200 grand for the piece.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KITSUNE|One of the demilitarized Kitsunes landed our way, and we've had one lying around. Didn't really see much point in using one, so may as well make an offer to you for it. We're offering 200 grand flat for it.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_213|I've got an old Cothon here, except this one's got a neat thing up it's sleeve. Three engines instead of one, packs a punch but it's Faraday cage is lost. Selling it at 200k.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_211|We've got a belter Cothon here. Excavator's larger than standard models, and is a little offset from te center. Damage is here and there, but it's still in one piece. I'll let you take it for 200 000 E$

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_BALD|Got our hands on a Bald Eagle of all things. Owner lost a race to a Cothon, and abandoned it in shame. Still a lovely piece of work dented or not. 3 mega and the bird is yours to collect.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_PELICAN|We've got our hands on a large Prospector. It's bay is huge for what it is, and it's mass is probably what got it in trouble to begin with. I couldn't tell you if it's flightworthy with the state it's in. 250 grand for it and I hope you'll see it gone.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_VULTURE|I've got a Prospector-K37 hybrid build stored up around here. It's nice to have with it's equipment, but sure is it uncomfortable to fly. We want it off our hands and will hand you the coords for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_OCP|Some of the construction crew for Obonto Seven left one of their ships unlocked while on an inspection break. Somehow managed to take it without them noticing until too late. It's too unwieldy for our liking, so you can take a look for 750 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_TITAN|Got a derelict Titan of all things stored up, cargo pods and everything. Huge thing it is, but damages to the rim and back. We can let you take it for a mega and a half.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_TITAN_BB|Have one of those hollowed-out Titans at hand. Beast of a ship with a cargo bay of an even bigger beast, although it does lack some of it's bays. We're offering a mega and a half for it.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_EIME|Found an EIME abandoned not too far from here. Surprising find to us at least as those ships are tough as nails when we try to engage with them. It's a total wreck, but you can have it for 2 mega.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_K37_I|I have a K37 in decent condition, still with transponders. Bit of holes in the reactor and some stains, but nothing a good mechanic can't take care of. I can sell it to you for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PROSPECTOR_I|We have a Prospector for sale. Cleared on the station a legitimate derelict after a mining accident. That one is not spaceworthy. 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_I|I got my hands on an early Cothon, in pretty good condition. Legitimate salvage, transponder still on, listed as missing. The reactor is still a bit leaky. On sale for 200 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_I|We have some ore to sell. High quality, processed, just waiting in the rings in a nice, tidy container. You just need to bring a cradle with you and grab it. 100 grand and it's yours.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_II|We have some ore to sell. High quality, processed, just waiting in the rings in a nice, tidy container. You just need to bring a cradle with you and grab it. 100 grand and it's yours.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_V|We have some ore to sell. High quality, processed, just waiting in the rings in a nice, tidy container. You just need to bring a cradle with you and grab it. 100 grand and it's yours.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_VI|We have a large quantity of ore to sell. High quality processed ore, stored in one of THI's supercontainers. You just need to bring a cradle and your wits with you to grab it. 100 grand and it's yours.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_ORE_BIG_INSTRUCTIONS|Pleasure doing business with you. The container won't recognize you and will try to evade you. Like usual, it's no racing drone, however it's got a heck of a lot more power behind it than the usual THICC. Look for a LIDAR contact and go after it. Remember to bring a cradle or an arm - it will shut itself down once you are in EVA distance.

SYSTEM_EXBIG|THI Interlunar Container

SYSTEM_EXBIG_DESC|From the success that THI's previous cargo solutions venture had become, they started work on a successor that would be increasingly practical for interplanetary transportation. As successful as the initial venture was, the containers were too bulky for commercial use, so a consumer-grade model was produced for interlunar transportation between the rings. Considerably more managable for miners, and the lack of a need for specialized thrust to power them made maintenance equivalent to that of the original Cargo Container line, however installation costs still make the THICC popular among startups.

SYSTEM_EXBIG_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 45,000 kg / mineral \nPower usage (nominal): 20 MW \nDry Mass: 5,000 kg \nCradle mass: 500 kg \nReaction Mass Tank: 4,500 kg \nManufacturer: Titan Heavy Industries, Experimental Resize

SYSTEM_EXBIG_MANUAL|Automatically stores processed ore.\nYou can customize ore stored on Geologist tab.\nRequires mineral processing unit to be used effectively.\nWill unbalance the ship if only one is installed.\nCan be ejected by disabling the hardpoint.\nThe ejected container will attempt to return to the station with its cargo automatically.\nEmpty cradle arm can catch drones and lifepods.

POI_SCRAP|Mining Incident Site

DIALOG_POI_RANDOM_6|Captain, one of my old colleagues looked me out in my quarters while we were back on Enceladus. They told me that my old captain had gotten into a mining incident. Can we take a look to see if they're ok?

DIALOG_MINER_SEEN_YES_BUILDING|We passed a new habitat nearby, they were undergoing construction, and needed some processed ore - but we don't have a mineral processor on {origin/shipname}.

SYSTEM_EXSUPER|Experimental Interplanetary Container

SYSTEM_EXSUPER_DESC|Modeled after the successful THI Cargo Container, the Interplanetary Container aimed to be a long-term storage solution equivalent for supplying both temporary and permanent research and habitation stations in the belts and rings of Sol, the interplanetary container was made to hold 6 times as much as the classic THICC. This extra hold made the container significantly bulkier, requiring six racing-grade reaction thrusters to be fitted, as well as equipping external remass tanks to supply them. This increased mass made it very impractical to fly with, and put most craft too off-balance to be controllable, thus unsuitable for the high maneuverability required to operate safely in the rings. They now are used purely for interplanetary travel. \n\nDue to the way equipment licensing operates on Enceladus Prime, they can still be obtained despite being condmened due to a grandfather clause, allowing any captain who legitimately salvages a vessel with the appropriate paperwork and licensing to be able to use them on any of their company's ships.

SYSTEM_EXSUPER_SPECS|Cargo capacity: 120,000 kg / mineral \nPower usage (nominal): 20 MW \nDry Mass: 25,000 kg \nCradle mass: 500 kg \nReaction Mass Tank: 30,000 kg \nManufacturer: Grandfathered (originally Titan Heavy Industries)

SYSTEM_EXSUPER_MANUAL|Automatically stores processed ore.\nYou can customize ore stored on Geologist tab.\nRequires mineral processing unit to be used effectively.\nWill unbalance the ship if only one is installed.\nCan be ejected by disabling the hardpoint.\nThe ejected container will attempt to return to the station with its cargo automatically.\nEmpty cradle arm can catch drones and lifepods.

DIALOG_INTERPLANETARY_WEIRD|What's up with this container anyway? It's got some very high-tech thrusters for a container, even if it is oversized. Perhaps someone like a historian could give us a better insight?

AGENDA_HISTORIAN_INTERPLANETARY_IS_IT|Hold on, isn't this one of those interplanetary containers? I knew it looked too big to be anything commercial.

AGENDA_HISTORIAN_INTERPLANETARY_IT_IS|Yeah, according to this databank entry on the history of cargo containers, the interplanetary container is the predecessor of the interlunar one, however condmened for use within the rings due to reliability costs and unstable mass shifts.

AGENDA_HISTORIAN_INTERPLANETARY_WONDER|Bet if we could find a ship with one of those experimental containers attached, we could grandfather a license for it. It could still hold some use even from how unreliable they were reported to be.

DIALOG_HABITAT_BUILDING_CONTAINER_ASK|We found one of those interplanetary containers just lying around in the rings. It didn't have a transponder, so we reprogrammed it as ours and sent it home. We had thought they were just found derelict from the failed tests before they were condemned.

DIALOG_HABITAT_BUILDING_CONTAINER_EXPLAIN|That would be one of the containers that we had sent to us. We were running behind schedule and made the decision to use them to speed up the shipments of minerals. We didn't think that we would lose so many to pirates.

DIALOG_HABITAT_BUILDING_CONTAINER_GRANDFATHER|As much as the containers are condemned in the rings, we have a contractor who was lucky enough to find a derelict from the old tests. The documents for the containers were still intact, and was allowed to use them by grandfathering the licenses. 

DIALOG_HABITAT_BUILDING_CONTAINER_FIND|Few of the ships fitted with them were ever tested in the rings, so finding one is practically impossible. If you ask around, you may be able to find someone who knows something about them, they may be able to help more than we can.

DIALOG_ASK_ABOUT_SUPER_THICC|We were wondering if you knew anything about what remains of the experimental interplanetary cargo containers that were tested in the rings?

DIALOG_ASK_SORRY|Sorry, nothing from us. We've heard only rumors about those.

DIALOG_ASK_HINTS|We don't know anything, but there is the occasional crew who try to find rare or unique items like those. You may get a better result if you come across one of those captains.

DIALOG_ASK_ACTUALLY_YES|Actually, yes we do have something. We found this old ship that we believe was used for testing them. We saved the coordinates, and it's not too far from here. By the sounds of it you may have a greater use for it than we will if you're asking.

DIALOG_SUPER_THICC_DERELICT_THIS|Well, this is supposed to be one of the testing ships for the interplanetary container. Doesn't appear to have one installed, so let's just hope that it's got the necessary paperwork onboard.

DIALOG_SUPER_THICC_DERELICT_THIS_GO|Do you have your EVA suit ready, {agenda/firstname}? We should check it out.

DIALOG_SUPER_THICC_DERELICT_THIS_EVA|Already preparing it. May as well make this trip as effortless as possible.

DIALOG_SUPER_THICC_DERELICT_THIS_DOCUMENTS|Looks like this hunk of junk really was ditched in a hurry. The cabin's full of paperwork. Luckily it seems the licensing documents are still in their cubby. Everything about them appears to be in check.

DIALOG_SUPER_THICC_DERELICT_THIS_TAKE|As much as it looks pretty damaged from the outside, looking over it's systems from the computer, much of it is still operational, and the reactor seems to be functional at least. I'll take this for a spin and figure out the rest at Enceladus.

DIALOG_STORAGE_DYNA|I need a new dyna container!

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_DRONE_OCP|Found what we presume is a civilian retrofit to one of those construction ships, comes with an extra drone point. We haven't found much use for it, so we're gonna offer it at 350 grand to get it off of our hands.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_HEAVY_COTHON|Got a very bizarre modification to an ancient Cothon with us. Has one of it's front low-stress hardpoints replaced with what looks like a high-stress one. Seems like a liability to us, so it could be yours for 250 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_TSUKUYOMI|We found a really old Tsukuyomi frigate around. Wrecked to hell and back, and probably nothing more than scrap in reality, but the hull is all there. Huge thing regardless, so we're offering seven and a half mega for it.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_STUB|I've got a short Titan variant around. It's got a decent bit of kit on it, but a very weird selection of what can be fitted to it. On offer for 900 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_ATLAS|We've got an experimental retrofit to those ATLAS Edgerunner ships in storage. Pretty much straps a lifepod and some other junk to one to let a crew fly it. No idea how legal it is, but yours for 400 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_COTHON_LUX|Got a premium Cothon variant in storage around. Pretty much improved on the old design in most ways, so we're going to add onto the usual price we offer for that line of ship. 250 grand for it all.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_PIDGEON|We have a Pidgeon Prospector around here. Basically an extended bay variant to the Vulture, with all the features that a Pelican provides. All yours for 550 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_CERF|There's a civilian retrofit to the MAD-CERF Search and Rescue ships not too far from here. It's lacking a few of the usual features and a swapped out habitat and hardpoint to provide more mining capability kinda makes it suboptimal for our use, so we're going to let you have it for 800 grand if it interests you.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_OBERON|We've found a high-performance racing vessel around. Miracle it's still in a single piece considering how badly damaged some of the parts to it are, but still there in it's glory. One mega for the entire thing.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_DEEP_DISH|Got a mining modification to the construction ship. Pretty much just adds a few features to the original vessel to make mining a slight bit easier, so not really too useful to us. All yours for 500 grand.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_SNAP|Got an early version of the OCP construction vessel. It's door holds two moving parts to it's opening rather than a single one that modern ships have, making it have a more central opening. The firmware even comes with sounds from a late 20th century videogame too. 500 grand for the vessel.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_OK720|Got a very weird project ship that welded an OCP cargo bay to the hull of one of the failed K44 vessels. Pretty much a huge bay to one of them. 300 grand for the full package.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_RAM|I've got a civilian modification to the K37 that provides several features from a Prospector class of ships. Very functional and good for mining, but kinda uncomfortable to fly. 250 grand for the vessel.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTI_COTHON_MKI|Found one of KTI's modified Cothon vessels. Holds up pretty well as a mining vessel compared to other more modern vessels, so definitely has it's value. 250 grand for the piece.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTI_COTHON_MKII|Found one of KTI's modified Cothon vessels. Holds up pretty well as a mining vessel compared to other more modern vessels, so definitely has it's value. 250 grand for the piece.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTI_K225|Found one of KTI's Titan retrofit kits. It's similar to a stock Titan, with a few additional equipment positions, with the prize feature of a second auxiliary power unit slot. It's yours for a million and a quarter.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTI_KSERIES|One of KTI's K-Series modifications fell into our hands. This one's a modification of the K37. Pretty much adds some docking bays to the stock loadout, nothing too fancy. 250 grand for the pick.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTI_KSERIES_LCB|One of KTI's K-Series modifications fell into our hands. This one's a modification of the KX37. Pretty much adds some docking bays to the stock loadout, nothing too fancy. 250 grand for the pick.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTI_KITSUMO|One of the demilitarized Kitsunes landed our way, and we've had one lying around. This one is one of KTI's attempts to improve it with a high-stress hardpoint and a torch slot. Didn't really see much point in using one, so may as well make an offer to you for it. We're offering 250 grand flat for it.

DIALOG_PIRATE_BUSINESS_SHIP_KTI_OCP230|Some of the construction crew for Obonto Seven left one of their ships unlocked while on an inspection break. Somehow managed to take it without them noticing until too late. This one appears to be one of KTI's modifications. It's too unwieldy for our liking, so you can take a look for 500 grand.

DIALOG_HABITAT_BUILDING_CONTAINER_YOU_SEEM|You know, I'm surprised that your superstructure hasn't been finished yet, don't you usually get shipments alongside miners providing you with minerals as they pass by?

DIALOG_HABITAT_BUILDING_CONTAINER_REASON|Normally we wouldn't mention this, even to contractors, however we believe you're trustworthy enough. \n\nWe have one contractor who managed to get their hands on a license to the experimental interplanetary containers. They had us sent them instead of standard cargo containers, albeit slower than usual shipments, but they provided a faster way to receive them. \n\nOf course, with this there was a risk. Fewer single shipments means a bigger impact if things go wrong, and they did. Most of the planned shipments go missing, and we haven't seen the contractor in a while to change the order. A few have reported the containers operating without a transponder, so we can only presume it's piracy.

DIALOG_HABITAT_BUILDING_CONTAINER_OBTAIN|As for how they obtained the licensing, we can't say for sure but we believe it's some form of grandfathering clause at Enceladus Prime's shipyard. Something to do with equipment being allowed to utilize the safety protocols given to it at the time of the license being issued. Probably means they found one of the ships left abandoned in the rings from when they were still in testing. Basically means that if you can find a ship that still has the licensing for them in tact, you can fit them to your ship.

DIALOG_HABITAT_BUILDING_CONTAINER_HELP|Perhaps if you ask around with other crews, you may be able to find someone who knows something about them, and they may be able to help more than we can.

SYSTEM_SCOOP_E|Nakamura Prototype Hunk Companion

SYSTEM_SCOOP_E_DESC|An early prototype to Nakamura's NT Mining Companion, this venture initially utilized a standard excavator hatch instead of the grinder fitting that are seen on the modern-day companions. As reliable as they were, they came at the cost of being very off-balance, thus wasting precious reaction mass in the process. They were phased out as grinders started becoming more commonplace, but still exist on the secondhand market for any personell interested in a slightly cheaper alternative.

They were phased out as grinders started becoming more commonplace, but still exist on the secondhand market for any personell interested in a slightly cheaper alternative.\n\nOne project team that was set to find a solution to the Hunk's balance problem proposed fitting a mineral processing unit within it, which not only solved part of the balance issue, also provided a way for the companion to reclaim some remass for an extended flight.

SYSTEM_SCOOP_L|NCT Blaze Companion

SYSTEM_SCOOP_L_DESC|The blaze was a rather high-risk venture by Coherent Light to improve the general efficiency of the NT companion. Nicknamed the Blaze, the replacement of the companion's usual mike with a CL-150 laser gave it almost unparalleled performance, however the laser was too much for the internal turbine to handle. The resulting frequent brownouts caused severe problems for the onboard computer, with several unintended effects on the autonomous systems.

The resulting frequent brownouts caused severe problems for the onboard computer, with several unintended effects on the autonomous systems.\n\nA subset of the Blaze model, a fitted mineral processing unit was intended to further make efficiencies, however an oversight in the programming meant that it was left running during standard operations, which only made the brownout issues worse.

SYSTEM_SCOOP_M|N-A Mining Companion

SYSTEM_SCOOP_M_DESC|A lesser known project for the mining companion team came together with Antonoff to produce a limited-run variation of the stock NT companion. This variant ran with a mass driver, and was initially intended with ambush combat in mind, closely mirroring the military techniques of the early to mid 21st century. They were slowly repurposed into mining drones as Nakamura demilitarized their ring operations, and still see some usage with a handful of crews.

They were slowly repurposed into mining drones as Nakamura demilitarized their ring operations, and still see some usage with a handful of crews.\n\nA third party modification brought in the mineral processing unit to the driver line of companions. Not too much use was seen from these lines of drones, but they became popular among the pirates as self-sustaining ambush drones.

SYSTEM_SCOOP_P|NT P-Type Mining Companion

SYSTEM_SCOOP_P_DESC|In the early 23rd century, a joint-venture between Nakamura Dynamics and Titan Heavy Industries produced autonomous mining drones in an attempt to automate ring excavation. While initially successful, drone swarms developed personality quirks in their neural networks which diminished performance over time, with drones engaging in social behavior rather than excavation. The autonomous mining project was ultimately canceled, but the drones were quietly refurbished and rebranded as Mining Companions, to be sold to independent miners.\n\nA secondhand retrofit from Titan came with the added mineral processing unit and respective storage. A 15 tonne variable processed hold provides a reasonable storage for the companion to use. Many crews lean towards this model over the standard NT companion due to a lower maintainance runtime, only coming back to the mothership to transfer minerals.
